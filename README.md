Accelerated learning/48 hour (relatively) game project.

The idea was to create a somewhat playable game in 48 hours with no engine and just a pipeline.

I used python for the implementation and paint.net for graphics. Whilst there are features that I would've liked to add the time was extremely limited.

Overall the time spent on the project was around 12 hours over the course of the weekend. This included development of ideas, code and graphics.

The code is NOT good and is not a reflection of my coding ability but more so the ability to create a concept within a short time frame (and of course to learn python).
